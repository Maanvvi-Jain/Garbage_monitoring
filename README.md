# Garbage_monitoring

A simple Arduino-based system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to monitor the garbage level in a dustbin. It continuously measures the distance from the sensor to the trash, and alerts when the bin is full. Useful for smart waste management and easily extendable with IoT features like GSM or Wi-Fi alerts.
